# EngFuck
Engfuck is pretty much just a joke coding "language" or whatever you want to call it. You have 4 options for manipulating  the string. "+" increments the value, "-"
decrements a value, "^" switches a character to uppercase, "#"  lets you add a number and "=" pushes the current value to the output. This can let you do some pretty stupid things despite how
little options you have. Yes this is written in javascript and runs the code as javascript, I just did this for fun not for it to be practical.

Example: print "Hello, world" to console
